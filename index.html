<p class="author-1">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</p>

<pre class="poetry">
The world is a beautiful place
            to be born into
      if you don’t mind happiness
                   not always being
            so very much fun
      if you don’t mind a touch of hell
            now and then
      just when everything is fine
            because even in heaven
      they don’t sing
            all the time

    <h2><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45479/when-i-heard-the-learnd-astronomer">When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer</a></h2>

<p class="author-2">Walt Whitman</p>

<p>When I heard the learn’d astronomer, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before me, <br />
When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divide, and measure them, <br />
When I sitting heard the astronomer where he<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, <br />
How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, <br />
Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself, <br />
In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, <br />
Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.<br /></p>

    <h2>The Animal Spell</h2>

<p class="author-3">Zachary Schomburg</p>

<p>Someone once told me that animals are people under spells, and if you fall in love with them the spell will be lifted. I recently fell in love with a black trumpeter swan. I watched her ruffle her neck feathers for hours, watched her peck bugs from her breast. I was sure she would make a beautiful bride, but she was always a black trumpeter swan. I once brushed a horse’s hair for 3 straight years until it crumpled into death. The truth is there is no such thing as spells. The world is always as it is, and always as it seems. And love is just our own kind voice that we whisper into our own blood.

    <h2><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48989/caged-bird">Caged Bird</a></h2>

<p class="author-4">Maya Angelou</p>

<p>The free bird thinks of another breeze<br />
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br />
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br />
and he names the sky his own<br />
<br />
But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams <br />
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   <br />
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   <br />
so he opens his throat to sing.<br />
<br />
The caged bird sings   <br />
with a fearful trill   <br />
of things unknown   <br />
but longed for still  <br />
and his tune is heard  <br />
on the distant hill <br />
for the caged bird  <br />
sings of freedom.<br />

<p class="author-5">Dylan Thomas</p>

<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br />
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />
<br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /></p>

<p class="author-6">T.S. Eliot</p>

<p>No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;<br />
Am an attendant lord, one that will do<br />
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,<br />
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,<br />
Deferential, glad to be of use,<br />
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;<br />
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;<br />
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—<br />
Almost, at times, the Fool.<br /></p>

<p class="author-7">William Carlos Williams</p>

<p>I have eaten<br />
the plums<br />
that were in<br />
the icebox<br />
<br />
and which<br />
you were probably<br />
saving<br />
for breakfast<br />
<br />
Forgive me<br />
they were delicious<br />
so sweet<br />
and so cold</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should head to the emergency room<br />
and just pop our heads in and say hello. Tell them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are alright so they don’t think we only visit when things are bad. We are breathing without tubes today.</p>
